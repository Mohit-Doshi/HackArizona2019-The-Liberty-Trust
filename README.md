An iOS Application that mobilizes volunteers and supporters towards causes, donation centers, and those seeking funding to help the numerous furloughed and laid off workers during and after the government shutdown


The iOS Application was designed for the latest version of iOS using Xcode and Swift 4. The application calls Google's Civic API to load details of the representatives for the user's current location. The application also has four ways for users to help out during the shutdown - volunteering, donating money, helping out at food banks, donating household supplies. Selecting a choice loads a map of nearby centers where the user can volunteer or donate. The application also uses a Google Maps API to reverse geocode coordinates into a location. Moreover, the app also uses MapKit NLP features to find nearby locations and places of interest.
